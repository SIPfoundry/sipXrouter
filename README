To install from source
=======================

Step 1. Build makefile.

 autoreconf -if
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/sipx SIPXPBXUSER=$USER

Step 2. Add yum repository for dependencies
There are libraries that are not available in common repositories that you'll need to to install. There's a file you can
add to your system that will allow it to pull dependecies from the sipfoundry 

  sudo 'make repofile > /etc/yum.repos.d/sipxecs.repo'

Step 3. Install missing dependencies

 make sipx.list-missings-deps | xargs sudo yum install

Step 4. Build and install. Make sure you have permission to directory listed in --prefix=

 sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sipx
 sudo chown $USER:$USER /usr/local/sipx
 make all-install

Step 5. To run. NOTE: This will run as the user you are currently looged-in as, even though you are starting w/root permissions

 sudo /usr/local/sipx/bin/sipxecs-setup
 sudo /usr/local/sipx/etc/init.d/sipxecs start
