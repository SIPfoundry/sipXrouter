                        09Kernel Parameter Help07

Some kernel parameters can be specified on the command line and will be
passed to the kernel.  This does not include options to modules for devices 
such as ethernet cards or devices such as CD-ROM drives.

To pass an option to the kernel, use the following format:

     0fsipx <options>07


If a different installation mode is desired, enter it after the option(s).

For example, to install on a system with 128MB of RAM using noprobe mode, 
type the following:

     0fsipx mem=128M noprobe07


To pass options to modules, you will need to use the noprobe mode to disable
PCI autoprobing.  When the installer asks for your device type that needs
an option or parameter passed to it, there will be a place to type those in
at that time.
