.SH "NAME"
regtimes \- displays a report of registrations
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
regtimes  [ { \-\-help | \-h } ]
          [ { \-\-summary | \-s } ]
          <sipregistrar.log>...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Show intervals for renewal of registrations.  The time for each registration of each contact is shown, with when the  previous expiration would have expired, the actual time it was renewed and the difference between them.  If the refresh is late (there was a period when the registration had expired), then that is flagged.

Note that in an HA system, you must provide the logs for all registrars or the output will report errors that did not happen.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\-\-summary   Successful refreshes are combined into a single line, 
            which considerably shortens the output
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Requires that the Perl module DateTime::Format::ISO8601 is installed.

To install from CPAN, use:
 cpan force install DateTime::Format::ISO8601

(there is a bug detected in the unit test that does not seem to be a problem for this module, but it means that you must use the 'force' command to install it)
