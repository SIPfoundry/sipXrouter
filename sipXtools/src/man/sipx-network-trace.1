.SH "NAME"
sipx\-network\-trace \- capture a brief period of network traffic
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
   sipx\-network\-trace [\-i <interface>]
                      [\-f <output file>]
                      [\-s <file size x 1,000,000 bytes>]
                      [\-r <number of files>]
                      [\-t <seconds to run>]
                      {start|stop|status}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Captures network packets sent to and from all sipXecs services for a brief period (default 10 minutes), or until stopped or killed. Output files are in SIPX_LOGDIR/trace.

Must be run as root
.SH "OPTIONS"
   \-i <interface>
      Which interface to listen on (default any, to capture packets sent
      from one service to another on the same box).

   \-f <output file>
      Base name for output files (default sipx\-net\-trace\-<datestamp>.pcap).
      Output is always in SIPX_LOGDIR/trace.  The files have a number appended
      to allow rotation through a maximum number of files (specified with \-r,
      default 10).

   \-s <file size x 1,000,000 bytes>
      The approximate size of each output file.  Once this size is reached,
      a new file is opened, or if the maximum number of files has been reached,
      output starts over beginning with 0.

    \-r <number of files>
      Maximum number of output files which will be created.

    \-t <seconds to run>
      Number of seconds of packets to capture (default 10 minutes).  The
      capture can be stopped or killed before this time has been reached.

    ACTIONS:
    start
      Begin network capture.  Only one capture can run at a time.
    status
      Check to see if a capture is already running.
    stop
      Stop the current network capture.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Requires tcpdump.
