INTRODUCTION
============
Preflight is a network test utility used to verify the functionality of various
network services which are required for proper operation of the sipXecs system.
It is capable of testing proper operation of the following network services:
  DHCP
  DNS
  NTP
  TFTP
  FTP
  HTTP

It can also perform basic testing of the sipXecs proxy, registrar and publisher.

In addition, it also has a device discovery feature which allows it to locate
and identify SIP compliant telephones attached to the same network for which
the host running preflight is.

For details on the operation of the command line version of preflight, invoke
with the "--help" switch.


BUILDING PREREQUISITES
======================
There are two different versions of preflight, a command line version which
can be invoked on the sipXecs server either from a command shell or from the
diagnostics screen of the Config Server, and an optional graphical version
which can be installed on either Windows XP or Vista.  The graphical version,
although targeted for a Windows system, is built as part of a normal Linux
build.  Before this can be accomplished, several prerequisit packages must be
installed:

NSIS
----
Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is a professional Open Source system used
to create Windows installers.  For more information about this package, visit:

	http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

NSIS can either be built from source or installed from pre-packaged RPM's.
Prepackaged RPM's can be retrieved from:

    wget http://repo.calcforge.org/centos/5/i386/nsis-2.28-1.i386.rpm
    wget http://repo.calcforge.org/centos/5/i386/nsis-data-2.28-1.noarch.rpm

or

    wget http://www.sipfoundry.org/???/nsis-2.28-1.i386.rpm
    wget http://www.sipfoundry.org/???/nsis-data-2.28-1.noarch.rpm

Note that the projects build script expects to find the NSIS executable,
"makensis" at either "/bin", "/usr/bin" or "/usr/local/bin".  If it is installed
at another location, it will be necessary to modify the ant build script
accordingly.

Java Runtime Environment
------------------------
A Java runtime environment must be included in the Windows installation.  It is
therefore necessary for the build process to have access to a copy at build
time.  The JRE must be of version 1.5.0 or greater and located within the
"libsrc/java-sun-windows" directory.  For convenience, a tar-ball of a
suitable JRE can be retrieved from:

    wget http://www.sipfoundry.org/???/java-sun-1_5_0_12-windows-i586.tgz

Just untar the contents into the "libsrc/java-sun-windows" directory prior to
building.

Note that the "libsrc" directory is by default expected to be located at the root
of the users home directory.  If an alternate location or directory name is
desired, set the environment variable "LIBSRC" accordingly.
