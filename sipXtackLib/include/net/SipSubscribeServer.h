//! Top level class for accepting and processing SUBSCRIBE requests
/*! This implements a generic RFC 3265 SUBSCRIBE server, also
 *  called a notifier.  This class receives SUBSCRIBE requests,
 *  retrieves the SIP event content from the SipPublisherContentMgr,
 *  generates a NOTIFY request with the retrieved event content, and sends
 *  the NOFITY using the SipUserAgent.  The SipSubscribeServer is
 *  designed so that it can handle several different event types and
 *  so that you can have multiple instances of the SipSubscribeServer
 *  each handling different event types.  However you can not have an
 *  event type that is handled by more than one SipSubScribeServer.
 *
 *  :BEWARE: It is probably not possible to make SipSubscribeServer work
 *  if the event type has parameters.  This is due to various architectural
 *  choices in identifying the relevant event type for a SUBSCRIBE request.
 *  This should be fixed at some point.
 *
 *  \par Event Specific Handling and Processing
 *  Event types are enabled with the enableEventType method.  This method
 *  handling and processing of the specified Event type to be specialized
 *  by providing an Event specific: SipEventPlugin, SipUserAgent and/or
 *  SipPublisherContentMgr.
 *
 *  \par Application Use
 *  An application which provides event state for a specific event type
 *  uses the SipPublishContentMgr to provide event state defaults as well
 *  as state specific to a resource.  The application enables the event
 *  type with the enableEventType method, providing the SipPublishContentMgr
 *  which contains the event state content for the event type.  The
 *  SipSubscribeServer provides the content for specific resource
 *  contained in the SipPublishContentMgr to subscribers.  The SipPublishContentMgr
 *  notifies the SipSubscribeServer (via callback to
 *  SipSubscribeServer::contentChangeCallback) of content changes made
 *  by the application.
 *
 *  \par
 *  Content is stored in a SipPublishContentMgr, indexed by
 *  'resourceId'.  Conventionally, the resourceId is a SIP URI (i.e.,
 *  "sip:user@hostport") stripped of any parameters.  When a SUBSCRIBE
 *  is received, it creates a subscription for the content of the
 *  resourceId which is derived from the request-URI of the incoming
 *  SUBSCRIBE.  Since SipPublishContentMgr::publish() can be given a
 *  list of bodies of varying media-type, SipSubscribeServer sends to
 *  the subscriber the published body whose media-type appears first
 *  in the Accept header of the SUBSCRIBE.  If no body is acceptable
 *  (including if SipPublishContentMgr has no content for this
 *  resourceId), then an error response (404 or 415) is given to the
 *  SUBSCRIBE and no subscription is created.
 *
 *  \par
 *  The application can remove all content for a
 *  resourceId/eventTypeKey combination using the
 *  SipPublishContentMgr::unpublish() method.  (The
 *  SipPublishContentMgr::publish() method requires at least one
 *  content type.)  unpublish() will cause any subscriptions for that
 *  resourceId/eventTypeKey to be terminated.  The exact method of
 *  termination is determined by the 'reason' argument to
 *  SipPublishContentMgr::unpublish(), which is passed to
 *  SipSubscribeServer::contentChangeCallback().
 *
 *  \par Subscription State
 *  The SipSubscriptionMgr is used by SipSubscribeServer to maintain
 *  the subscription state (SUBSCRIBE dialog state, not event state
 *  content).
 *
 *  \par Overall Data Flow
 *  The SipSubscribeServer needs to address 4 general stimuli:
 *  1) Respond to incoming SUBSCRIBE requests and send the cooresponding
 *     NOTIFY request.
 *  2) Generate NOTIFY requests when the event state changes for a resource
 *     that has an non-expired subscription.
 *  3) Generate NOTIFY requests to subscriptions when they expire.
 *  4) Some notification error responses should terminate the subscription
 *
 *  When enabling a SIP event type via the enableEventType method,
 *  the SipSubscribeServer registers with
 *  the SipUserAgent to receive SUBSCRIBE requests and NOTIFY responses
 *  for the event type, which are processed by the handleMessage method.
 *  Applications that publish event state use the SipPublishContentMgr
 *  to update resource specific or default event states.  The SipSubscribeServer
 *  is notified by the SipPublishContentMgr (via callback to
 *  SipSubscribeServer::contentChangeCallback) that the
 *  content has changed and sends a NOTIFY to those subscribed to the
 *  resourceId for the event type key.  The SipSubscribeServer uses
 *  timers to keep track of when event subscriptions expire.  When a timer
 *  fires, a message gets queued on the SipSubscribeServer which is
 *  passed to handleMessage.
