     *         transaction.  Note: this is not the same as the dialog state.
     *         The dialog state is indicted by the fact that expiration
     *         is in the future (i.e. subscribed or registered) or in the
     *         past or zero (i.e. expired).
     *         Note that a callback with requestState == REFRESH_REQUEST_FAILED
     *         requires a call of stopRefresh to purge the state information
     *         from the SipRefreshManager.
     *  \param earlyDialogHandle - always provided (which is changed
     *         from previous versions of this method, which only provided
     *         earlyDialogHandle while the refresh was being established)
     *         the dialog just changed to an established dialog otherwise NULL
     *  \param dialogHandle - provided if dialog is established otherwise NULL
     *  \param applicationData - pass back of application data provided upon
     *         adding SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER to be refreshed
     *  \param responseCode - SIP response code 200-299 Success, > 300 failure
     *         Has no meaning if subscribeResponse is NULL
     *         NOTE: a failure code does not mean that the subscription or
     *         registration has expired.  The previous SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER
     *         may have succeeded and may not have expired yet.
     *  \param responseText - SIP response text. NULL if subscribeResponse is NULL
     *  \param expiration - epoch time in seconds when expiration of subscription
     *         or registration will occur.  A value of zero indicates that
     *         a unSUBSCRIBE or unREGISTER occurred and that it has expired
     *         and that no further attempts will be made to reSUBSCRIBE or
     *         reREGISTER.  Usually zero indicates that the application stopped
     *         the refresh.  A value of -1 indicates that no requests have
     *         succeeded yet. A value greater than zero and less than the
     *         current epoch time indicates the SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER has
     *         expired, most likely because of a request failure.
     *  \param subscribeResponse - SIP SUBSCRIBE or REGISTER response which
     *         stimulated the state change.  May be NULL.  Ownership retained
     *         by SipRefreshManager.
     *
     *  All callbacks are called from the SipRefreshManager's thread.  In
     *  particular, no locks will be held by the thread when the callback is
     *  called.
     *  All refreshes eventually generate callbacks, if only to report the
     *  failure of the initial request.

     *  The request can be out-of-dialog, or in-dialog (e.g.,
     *  generated from a NOTIFY from a fork of a SUBSCRIBE from which
     *  we did not receive a response).
     *
     *  SipRefreshManager sends the request and re-sends it periodically
     *  as indicated by the accepted expirations seen in responses.
     *  Failure responses due to authentication challenges are re-sent
     *  immediately.  Failure responses due to defined transient error
     *  conditions are retried with exponential backoff.  (Except not for
     *  initial SUBSCRIBE requests, as a retry might collide with established
     *  subscriptions.)
     *  The state of the refresh dialog/quasi-dialog is reported via the
     *  callback function.
     *
     *  Certain immediate error conditions (generally, if the dialog identifiers
     *  of subscribeOrRegisterRequest match a currently active refresh) cause
     *  initiateRefresh to return false, in which case no state is created
     *  and there will be no callback.  Otherwise, initiateRefresh returns
     *  true (immediately upon sending the request), a state is
     *  created, but success of the attempted request can only be determined
     *  by monitoring the callbacks.
     *
     *  The caller of this method must explictly call stopRefresh
     *  to clean up the refresh state, even if the callback function
     *  has reported REFRESH_REQUEST_FAILED.
     *
     *  State changes for the refresh are always reported via the callback
     *  function, including the initial state set by initiateRefresh and
     *  the transition to REFRESH_REQUEST_FAILED caused by calling stopRefresh
     *  on a refresh that has not terminated.
