/** Class for managing body content to be accepted via PUBLISH or provided in NOTIFY requests
 *
 *  This class is a database that is used to store and retrieve
 *  content (i.e. SIP Event state bodies).  This class does not touch
 *  or process SIP messages.  It is used by other classes and
 *  applications to store and retrieve content related to SIP
 *  SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and PUBLISH requests.  The usual usage is to
 *  have one instance that maintains state for an unlimited number of
 *  resources and event types.
 *
 *  The resourceId and eventTypeKey have no semantics.  Syntactically,
 *  they are restricted only by:  (1) resourceId, eventTypeKey, and
 *  eventType may not be the null string, and (2) eventTypeKey may not
 *  contain a byte with the value 1 (control-A), so that the
 *  concatenation of resourceId and eventTypeKey can be split
 *  unambiguously.
 *
 *  It is up to the application or event package to decide what the
 *  resourceId and eventTypeKey look like.  In addition, there is an
 *  eventType that may provide a coarser classification than
 *  eventTypeKey.  Callback functions are registered for eventTypes
 *  rather than eventTypeKeys, which makes it easier to extend the set
 *  of eventTypeKey dynamically.
 *
 *  A suggested convention for the resourceId
 *  is to use:  sip:<userId>@<hostname>[:port] as provided in the
 *  SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH request URI.  It is suggested that host be
 *  the SIP domainname, not the specific IP address of the host
 *  running the process, and that any URI parameters be omitted.
 *
 *  It is also suggested the SIP event type token be used (without any
 *  event header parameters) as the eventTypeKey.  Only in special
 *  cases where the content varies based upon an event parameter,
 *  should the parameter(s) be include included in the eventTypeKey.
 *  Usually, eventType is the same as eventTypeKey, or is the
 *  SIP event type alone, if eventTypeKey contains parameters.
 *
 * \par Putting In Event Content
 *  Applications put Event content information for a specific resourceId
 *  and eventTypeKey into the SipPublishContentMgr via the publish method.
 *
 * \par Retrieving Event Content
 *  Applications retrieve published content type via the getContent
 *  method.
 *
 * \par Removing Event Content
 *  All event content information for a resource Id and event type key can
 *  can be removed via the unpublish method.
 *
 * \par Default Event Content
 *  It is possible to define default content for an eventTypeKey.
 *  This default content is provided by the getContent method if no
 *  content was provided for the specific resource Id.  Default content
 *  is set via the publishDefault method.
 *
 * \par Default Event Content Constructor
 *  It is possible to define a default content constructor for an
 *  eventTypeKey.
 *  A default content constructor can be provided for an eventTypeKey
 *  by calling another publishDefault method.
 *  When a SUBSCRIBE arrives for an event with no provided content,
 *  the constructor is called to provide content.  The constructor may
 *  choose to provide no content for the resource.
 *
 *  The default content for an eventTypeKey is not expected to change,
 *  and so changes to default content do not trigger callbacks.
 *
 *  When content is searched for, the order of searching is:
 *  - content 
 *    provided by publish()
 *  - default content
 *    provided by publishDefault(..., SipPublishContentMgrDefaultConstructor*)
 *  - default content
 *    provided by publishDefault(..., HttpBody*)
 *
 * \par Full vs. Partial Content
 *  Content is recorded for two flavors, "partial" and "full".
 *  For any one eventType, the application uses full content only, or
 *  it uses both full and partial content for all resources.
 *  If both flavors are used, both flavors for a given resourceId are
 *  expected to be updated together.  (Changes to full content should
 *  be published before changes to partial content to avoid a race
 *  condition.)
 *  The two flavors are stored and retrieved independently, as
 *  specified by parameters to the various methods.
 *
 * \par Content Change Callback
 *  setContentChangeObserver sets a callback function.  It will be
 *  called when the content for a resource changes.  Note that changes
 *  to default content do not trigger callbacks, as default content is
 *  not expected to change during operation.  If both full and partial
 *  content are used, full content updates should specify noNotify =
 *  true, and only partial content updates will cause callbacks.
 *  Note that only one callback can be registered per eventType.
 *
 * \par Content Types
 *  It is expected that the set of content types available for a given
 *  resourceId/eventTypeKey will not change over time, with the exception
 *  of when content is provided for a resourceId that previously had none,
 *  or when content is removed for a recourceId that previously had some.
 *  An implication of this is that if fixed default content is provided,
 *  all recourceId's will have content for that set of content types.
 *
