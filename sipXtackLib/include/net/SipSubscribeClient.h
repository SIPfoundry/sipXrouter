//! Class for maintaining the subscriber role of SIP subscriptions
/** Once a SipSubscribeClient has been created, it can be directed to
 *  create and maintain subscriptions.  SUBSCRIBE messages are sent
 *  using addSubscription.  Each use of addSubscription creates an
 *  early dialog, and any subscriptions that are established are
 *  created as established dialogs.  The creation and destruction of
 *  early and established dialogs is reported through a callback
 *  function, and the contents of any NOTIFYs received in the
 *  subscriptions is reported through another callback function.
 *
 *  Normally, if an established subscription is ended due to error or
 *  action of the notifier, SipSubscribeClient attempts to reestablish it.
 *  In addition, each group of subscription dialogs is terminated and
 *  reestablished on a long time period (12 to 24 hours).
 *  Both of the above behaviors can be suppressed for a subscription by
 *  optional arguments to addSubscription.
