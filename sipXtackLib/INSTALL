Required Software
=================
sipXportLib 2.5.0
  http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXportLib


Optional Software
=================

Only required for sipviewer installation, see below

  Java SDK 1.4.2 (tested w/1.4.2.03)
    http://java.sun.com

  Ant 1.6 (tested with 1.6.1)

    Ant can be installed from tar/zip files:

    * http://mirrors.mix5.com/apache/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.zip
    * http://mirrors.mix5.com/apache/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.tar.gz
    * http://mirrors.mix5.com/apache/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.tar.gz
    From main page http://ant.apache.org/

    Or it can be installed from RPMs:

    If installing via RPMs, you'll need the following RPMs both of
    which can be found on http://rpm.pbone.net. Although you'll only
    need versions 1.6.1. or better. At the time of this note, 1.6.1
    was no longer available, but 1.6.2 was so I'll list them here:

      * ant-1.6.2-1jpp.noarch.rpm
        ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/www.jpackage.org/jpackage/1.5/generic/devel/RPMS/ant-1.6.2-1jpp.noarch.rpm

        ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/pub/Linux/packages/redhat/10/sourceforge/j/jp/jpackage/direct_download/1.5/generic/devel/RPMS/ant-1.6.2-1jpp.noarch.rpm

      * ant-junit-1.6.2-1jpp.noarch.rpm
        ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/www.jpackage.org/jpackage/1.5/generic/devel/RPMS/ant-junit-1.6.2-1jpp.noarch.rpm

For Sipviewer installation only

  The Sipviewer requires Ant version 1.6 or later.

  Check what version of ant is installed via 'rpm -q ant'.

  The ant binary tar file is available at
  http://mirrors.midco.net/pub/apache.org/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.tar.gz

  Untar ant-1.6.2.tar.gz into the /usr/java directory.

  Required Environment Variables

     JAVA_HOME - The location of the Java DK home directory.
                 For example: /opt/sun-jdk-1.4.2.04
     ANT_HOME - The location of the Ant directory.
                Needed if Ant is not installed via a standard RPM.
                For example: /usr/java/apache-ant-1.6.2

  ./configure [options]

Noteworthy options:

  --help                    See list of all options

  --disable-sipviewer       Do not try to compile java based sipviewer program
                            (This will not require you to install Java, Ant
                            or JUnit)
