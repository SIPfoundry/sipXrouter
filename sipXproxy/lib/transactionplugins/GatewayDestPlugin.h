 * This plugin takes care of providing the correct gateway destination for
 * transferring scenarios which use multiple gateways.
 *
 * 1. First, the plugin detects calls which have a gateway as destination and
 * save the gateway's lineid in top Via header to be retrieved in the
 * call response.
 *
 * 2. If a call which had a gateway as destination is successful, the plugin
 * add a new record in GatewayDestDB with information about the call and the
 * gateway id.
 *
 * 3. If the call originator is involved in any call transfer or pickup
 * scenario the plugin makes sure that any INVITE request with Replaces
 * would follow the same gateway
