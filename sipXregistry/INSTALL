Installation
=====================

  Once all of the above are installed, the following will do a default
  installation of sipXregistry:

  ./configure
  make
  
  As root:

  make install

Configuration
=====================
 
  If you are installing this as part of sipXpbx, you should use the
  facilities provided by the sipXconfig configuration utilities to
  configure the system.  

  If you are using this without the sipXconfig utilities, there are some
  (probably inadequate) hints on configuration in the doc/ directory.
