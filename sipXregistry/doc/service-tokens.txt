Internally-generated URI user-parts are allocated according to this
scheme:

	~~xx~arbitrary

where "xx" is a two-letter code specifying the sipX facility that is
responsible for allocating the user-part, and "arbitrary" is an
arbitrary string allocated by the facility (within the valid syntax
for SIP URI user-parts).

External and user-driven URI allocation methods are forbidden to
allocate URIs (within the domains that sipX is authoritative for) that
begin with "~~".

The assigned facility codes are:

*** gr

GRUUs and similar URIs.

	~~gr~xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
		Where "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is a 64-bit hex number
		generated by GRUU assignment.

	Translated internally by sipregistrar to the destination
	contact.

*** mh

The music-on-hold source.

	~~mh~
		The default music-on-hold source.  In the standard
		configuration, it is sip:moh@(domain):5120.

	Translated by mappingrules.xml to a contact at sipxpark.
	The mappingrules entry is generated by Config Server when the
	dial plan is activated.

*** rl

Resource-list URIs.  (See RFC 4662.)

	~~rl~xxx
		Where "xxx" is an arbitrary string assigned by the
		Config Server, which generates the configuration for
		the Resource List Server.

	Translated by mappingrules.xml to a contact at sipxrls.
	The mappingrules entry is generated by Config Server when the
	dial plan is activated.
