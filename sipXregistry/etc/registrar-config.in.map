# A mapping of the "NEW" keys in registrar-config.in to the old ones.
# used by configmerge to upgrade a system from the old to the new 
# configuration keys.   Additional keys are added/removed from the 
# registrar-config.in file delivered with the new RPM.  
#
# It is safe to apply the same map multiple times, although it is
# expected that this map be reset on each upgrade.
#
# Upgrades that need no mapping may have the map empty, or the
# file may be non-existant.
#
# The rule is:
#  {key in new config file} : {original key from old config file}
#
# These values map 3.{next} 3.{now} 
# {empty until a mapping is needed for a particular branch}
